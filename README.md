# UVRS2020

This is a working document to help
with the UVRS scoring for 2020.

## setup

The heavy lifting is done by the
[https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/](camelot)
package which can be installed with `pip` or the `conda-forge`
channel of `Anaconda`.

## paths to race results and rosters

For privacy reasons I will not include race results or rosters here
but instead it will be up to the user to set variables
`path_to_raceresults` and `path_to_roster` manually.
